# Geometric Series Bouncing Ball GUI

## Overview
The Geometric Series Bouncing Ball GUI is a Java-based application that provides a graphical simulation of a bouncing ball following a geometric series pattern. This educational and interactive tool is designed to visually demonstrate the principles of geometric series in physics, particularly as they apply to the motion and rebounding of an elastic ball.

## Features
- **Realistic Simulation**: Accurately simulates the bouncing ball behavior using geometric series principles.
- **Interactive GUI**: Offers a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to adjust parameters such as the initial height, elasticity coefficient, and gravity.
- **Educational Tool**: Serves as a practical demonstration for students and enthusiasts to understand geometric series in a dynamic and engaging way.
- **Visualization of Data**: Provides graphical visualization of the ballâ€™s motion, including trajectory and rebound heights.

## Getting Started
To start using the Geometric Series Bouncing Ball GUI, ensure that Java is installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the project directory and execute the application using your Java IDE or from the command line.
